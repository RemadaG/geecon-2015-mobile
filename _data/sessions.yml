  title: "Distributed Systems explained (with NodeJS)"
  description: "Since I've been working on distributed systems I always wanted to go back in time and teach myself what I know now, in order to avoid the silly mistakes I did! Things like vector clocks, the CAP theorem, how replication really works (and why it's needed), what BASE means and in general all about how this stuff really works! 
This is the speech I'd needed when wrote my first distributed system and it's something you need to know if you fancy working in this area. And we will also be coding some very simple examples in NodeJS, with working demos where we will kill processes and freeze networks! It's so easy to understand when you see things in action, we will use powerpoint only for some introductory theory! 
Yep, I am not a big believer of diagrams... show me code!"

  title: "TestContainers – integration testing without the hassle"
  description: "Unit testing is nice, but without a proper integration testing you might not know how your application will behave once it's deployed to the real environment. Before the Docker, configuring the environment for integration testing was painful – people were using fake database implementations, mocking servers, usually it wasn't cross-platform as well. But now, we can easily prepare the environment with Docker for our tests. In this talk I would like to spread the word about TestContainers ( <a href='https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java' style='color:LightGrey'>https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java</a> ) – a Java library that supports JUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container. A year ago we (ZeroTurnaround) decided to join our Docker-based test engine and TestContainers, and now it's open-sourced, available to everyone, so you can test your apps like we do :)"

  description: "With Java 9 and Jigsaw project around the corner (this time apparently for real), we finally need to stop pretending we can simply ignore the concept of modularity in Java! The thing is - modularity is NOT just some new framework! Neither it is a simple set of APIs! It's a complex concept that has been around for almost as long as the industry itself. So in this talk I'd like to take a step back and reason about the fundamental idea of modularity in Java by comparing the concepts of Jigsaw with other Java modularity approaches and implementations that have been around for quite some time."

  description: "Traditionally, Java developers have a strong dislike for JavaScript. Justifiably so, of course. JavaScript lacks a range of features that we all know and love in Java. However, JavaScript has been gradually taking over the frontend landscape. Since JavaScript is the native language of the browser and the browser is available on all devices, the relevance of JavaScript is no longer in question. The only question is how to choose the right tools for the job, since the JavaScript ecosystem is filled with a wide range of technologies, libraries, and tools.

In this session, you will learn how the speaker, a Java developer, has bit by bit, over time, come to like JavaScript. Not so much the language, but the ecosystem and the range of possibilities available. By the end of the session, you will have a thorough perspective on everything the JavaScript ecosystem can do for you, as a Java developer, and how you can make sense of the instability/vibrancy of the JavaScript ecosystem, too.

  description: "The rate of business change is accelerating. Organisations must learn to build the right things better and faster to survive.

Continuous delivery and lean product management help deliver “better and faster”. But we need practices to ensure the “right things” flow into these processes. Practices that help experiment and innovate with new business models, products and services before technical solutions are commissioned.

This need presents technology departments an opportunity to increase their contribution towards organisational agility. Partnering with business to implement such practices and ensure diverse, cross-functional participation is crucial to ensure building the “right things”.

One approach is to introduce GV design sprints into the demand process. Design sprints are a mix of business strategy, innovation, behaviour science and design thinking. They answer critical business questions, focus on greatest impact first, identify new consumer opportunities and lead to smarter allocation of resources.

In this talk we explore the use of design sprints in an enterprise environment to:

<li> Bridge the business-IT divide
</li><li> Build the right thing
</li><li> Increase organisational agility</li>

Thanks to optimizing dynamic native code compilers, Java performance today is very close to the performance of low level languages ​​such as C/C++, and is even better on some classes of applications. Along with dynamic compilers, static compilers for Java have been evolving as well, so there is still no clear winner among these two approaches. It should then come as no surprise that an AOT compiler is finally going to appear even in the HotSpot JVM and OpenJDK via JEP-295, which is officially included in Java 9."

Exception raising/handling is a popular and ingrained mechanism for dealing with faults. Unfortunately, this mechanism is not without issues: confusing control flow, performance problems, ignored faults and bugs that are very hard to understand. But moreover, exception handling is abused; Even in languages with checked exceptions, studies consistently find that the majority of exceptions are ignored, swallowed or handled by a default snippet. It's not uncommon to see elaborate machine learning systems crunching terrabytes of logs to filter out hordes of meaningless exception messages thrown from our code. We can do better.

We will go through both runtime Annotation handling using reflection and compile time Annotation Processors, see how we can utilize this knowledge to build synoptic, concise code that plays well with the Android platform. We will have quick outline how popular libraries embrace Java Annotations to tackle various real world problems, such as networking calls or persistence. Special consideration will be given to various design and architectural patterns, often thoughtlessly transferred from the Java Enterprise, where they might be poor match for mobile development for Android and how Annotations might help simplify developers life together with making the application more robust.

  description: "The beautiful thing about software engineering is that it gives you the warm and fuzzy illusion of total understanding: I control this machine because I know how it operates. This is the result of layers upon layers of successful abstractions, which hide immense sophistication and complexity. As with any abstraction, though, these sometimes leak, and that's when a good grounding in what's under the hood pays off. The second talk in this series peels a few layers of abstraction and takes a look under the hood of our 'car engine', the CPU. While hardly anyone codes in assembly language anymore, your C# or JavaScript (or Scala or...) application still ends up executing machine code instructions on a processor; that is why Java has a memory model, why memory layout still matters at scale, and why you're usually free to ignore these considerations and go about your merry way. You'll come away knowing a little bit about a lot of different moving parts under the hood; after all, isn't understanding how the machine operates what this is all about?"

  description: "Everyone is talking about microservices, and there is more confusion than ever about what the promise of microservices really means and how to deliver on it. To address this we will explore microservices from first principles, distilling their essence and putting them in their true context: distributed systems.

What many people forget is that microservices are distributed and collaborative by nature and only make sense as systems—one collaborator is no collaborator. It is in between the microservices that the most interesting and rewarding, and also challenging, problems arise—enter the world of distributed systems. 

Distributed systems are by definition complex, and we system developers have been spoiled by centralized servers for too long to easily understand what this really means. Slicing an existing system into various REST services and wiring them back together again with synchronous protocols and traditional enterprise tools—designed for monolithic architectures—will set us up for failure. 

As if that wasn’t enough, we can’t just think about systems of microservices. In order to make each microservice resilient and elastic in and of itself, we have to design each individual microservice as a distributed system—a «microsystem»—architected from the ground up using the reactive principles."

Solid understanding of Scala and Akka is required to fully understand it. It will include code samples illustating the Akka Typed API as well as the behavior-driven actor design."

  description: "Basic functional concepts like immutable data, second-order functions, lambdas and function composition can already be found in the modern programmer’s toolkit. During this talk you will learn about more advanced functional concepts and how they can solve real problems. I will talk about pattern matching, algebraic data types, type classes, functional abstractions, folding and type-level programming. I will show you a practical example written using today’s Java functional constructs and build up from there. I will use only JVM-based languages to show you how they can improve the code, make it more maintainable and safe."

  description: "When we talk about objects, we think about their behaviors, attributes and interactions. We think about the things they help us achieve. Yet, before any object can participate in any kind of operation or calculation, we first have to create it. Easy? Well, sometimes it is harder than you expect. Unfortunately as developers we tend to tackle even the simplest problem in an over-complicated way. During the talk I will show you the ways of creating objects and I will present you all problems that come with each solution. I will also talk about the problems that become more visible when you create your objects in the right way."

  description: "Event sourced domain naturally leads to messaging infrastructure and CQRS based services. See how we can benefit from getting rid of typical relational database model replaced by events. See how events come along with projections and different read model. In this talk we are going to explore all of this backed by a real Spring Cloud Stream applications. Don't ever lose information in your ORM-based system again. Leverage eventual consistency and event-driven architecture with the usage of pure Spring tools. Let's look into internals of databases and see that ideas like ES and CQRS are not new ones. For the fans of Functional Programming, see how you can model your domain with just functions, pattern matching, left fold and immutability. I would like to focus on several aspects: 1. Where to apply Event Sourcing - which is often wrongly recognized as architectural pattern 2. How Event Sourcing is different than ORM-based system with dirty checking. 3. How to apply Event Sourcing with just relational database and spring tools, which can be a good fit for a majority of projects 4. How we can deal with eventual consistency, blue/green deployments, replication, functional decomposition and scaling when using ES/CQRS"

Well, ordinary adding lines to /var/log and tracing them with tail -f or searching with grep is so... 1980 and inefficient. Meet Graylog: a centralised and distributed log management system. A tool, which will let you gather, process, analyse logs from many sources: syslog, your application, Apache/ngix, database, firewall, etc. It can alert, search all ways throug, analyse the logs no matter what language/technology sent them. And it makes that good. And is Open Source. This presentation is about some gotchas based on real-life experience, quick Graylog setup, wiring your apps/systems/servers, analysing logs after.

  description: "There's a shortage of people that you can hire. There are problems to find promising, good or even proper candidates when you want to recruit. You are getting more and more certain, that education in the universities are not enough. Or perhaps you would even phrase it harsher. You're not the only one, I talked with boys and girls thinking whether after lycée or tech-school they should go straight to work, 'for studies are useless'. And because you (or your team, or your boss, or your company) have problems with letting people go, you're afraid of saying 'YES' to the candidate, unless you're really convinced (as you should!). Solution: hire and teach them yourself. Last year I prepared and led a Java Academy program. I was hired just to do it. Rules were simple: interview, choose most promising ones, teach them for 3 months interspersed with mock interviews to gauge progress. Program was repeated. Afterwards, I used variation of it to introduce manual testers to Java. During this presentation, you will learn: - what I did, - what worked, - what failed to work, despite seemingly having no reasons to, - what you need to do to have such a program (and why), - how taxing that is.

an astonishing variety of substances together in the search for new
materials. While Alchemy is often derided for its informal approach,
early Alchemists paved the wave for modern chemistry, and included
Newton and Boyle among their number.
 
Just as the crucible encouraged an experiential and experimental
approach to understanding the world, so too the computer can provide a
computational crucible. Code can be mixed and brought to great
temperature in the search for greater understanding and new discovery.
 
Using his own Extempore programming language Andrew will provide a

Based on experience from multiple companies, projects and f*ck ups, we would like to propose certain maturity criteria which organizations must embrace to start with microservices approach. Without these, things might work but times might become even harder. We will walk through multiple practices essential for successful microservices rollout, validate them and justify. This won’t be a purely technical talk - no successful change in the organisation happened on purely technical bases. We will correlate the maturity criteria with some business drivers, which help team-up business and technical guys on the same side.

Are Polish (or other CEE) IT specialists less intelligent or worse than their colleagues from the West? Or maybe it’s about the huge capital those countries have and we don’t. Or maybe the problem is in our approach to IT and our mindset?
Regardless of the true reasons, as the effect, tens and hundreds of thousands of relatively low-cost and controllable people in Poland and other CEE countries work on conserving and maintaining software systems envisioned and usually designed elsewhere. Together with other emerging countries, we have become a development plantation for the most modern countries.

  description: "Did you ever asked yourself a question: What really happens when your Java program runs? After the transformation from Java source through bytecode and machine code to microcode, and the various optimizations that take place along the way, the instructions that are actually executed may be very different from what you imagined when you wrote the program. This session shows you tools and techniques for tracing that path. You’ll see what a simple program actually looks like when it really hits the hardware."

  title: "Common mistakes when moving to microservices"
  description: "While helping organizations move to microservices and public clouds, I’ve noticed a lot of common problems. Architecture is described at infrastructure level (k8s, cloud services, etc.) without any focus on domain architecture. Enterprise architects are put in charge of software architecture. Architecture guilds are created without introducing the required practices and culture. QA still thinks that end to end tests are possible. Managers want to sign-off and control deployments. Pipelines and processes are forced on devs, not allowing them to become devops (the culture doesn’t change). Devs do not learn the different flavors of event based architecture, relying on REST everywhere. Kafka is treated as a message queue (no streaming, no read models, no persistence). Half-baked tools provided as a service by the cloud are assumed to be cheaper/safer to use than self-hosted open source. Teams are created without repo ownership, creating an error prone setup. Finally business pivots are not taken into account, when designing the system. I’ll discuss all those problems, and hopefully provide some usable solutions."

  description: "These days rule and workflow engines are often overlooked, possibly because people think that they are only useful inside heavyweight enterprise software products. However, this is not necessarily true. Simply put, a rule engine is just a piece of software that allows you to separate domain and business-specific constraint from the main application flow. Similarly a workflow engine allows you to put higher level abstraction (not always in graphical representation) over your logic, yet keeping you focused on actual business goal. We are the project leads of Drools and jBPM, respectively the rule and workflow engine of Red Hat, and our target was to modernize our projects and make them ready to be used in serverless environments. In this talk we will explore and make sense of technologies like GraalVM and Quarkus. In particular we will show, with very practical use cases like ours, what is necessary to change in a code base making extensive use of reflection, dynamic class loading and other Java sorceries in order to make it compatible with those technologies and demonstrate how this is allowing us to make Drools and jBPM part of the cloud and serverless revolution."

Moreover a completely new tree of dynamic languages (JavaScript, Python) has meanwhile flowered into at first sight independent ecosystem of its own. Do the API design advises still apply? They (mostly) do. However rather than showing how to apply them to each different language one by one, let's try something more advanced. Let's design a single Polyglot API that works for all of them! This session will show how to take an existing Java API and add polyglot flavor to it. We show how to use that new polyglot API from JavaScript, Python, etc. We demonstrate how (surprisingly) fast and efficient such execution can be.

MicroProfile brings common reactive APIs that can be reused in many libraries to provide a unified experience for many Java developers. Including reactive operators, messaging, REST and more. The core MicroProfile reactive operators API is designed with care by experts behind popular reactive libraries. MicroProfile also provides reactive APIs for asynchronous messaging, REST and thread-control, as well as interceptors to improve the fault-tolerance of your applications. On top of that, MicroProfile aspires to bring unified reactive APIs to Jakarta EE and even to Java SE to make them more accessible to every Java developer. Learning MicroProfile API once will make it easier to get you started with many reactive frameworks with less additional learning."

Using Pyramid of testing we can set up the tests coverage of the existing functionality reaching given level (UI, modules, packages, classes, methods). This allows us to have a look at corresponding pyramid of refactoring and figure out what kind of refactorings can be performed safely. We start from the bottom of testing pyramid (simpler conditions, smaller methods) and climb up towards the highest level that is covered by tests. This concept will be presented using live refactoring of simple logic into interpreter design patterns. This way we will experience that refactoring at higher levels (design patterns, classes) can be continued only once lower levels like small methods, small classes, interfaces are being taken care of.

  description: "
We’ve seen significant benefits from choosing a microservice architecture for building enterprise applications, which allows us to structure teams based on business capabilities, improve scalability and enable the flexibility of being polyglot in the usage of technologies. Mostly this architecture is then complemented by a feature-rich and powerful browser application which sits on top of these backend-services. Unfortunately, the latter step ends up way too often in the creation of a single, sprawling and hard to maintain frontend-monolith.

The approach of micro frontends is an effective way to tackle this problem and first appeared at the end of 2016 on the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar. By going into detail about the underlying concepts of this architectural style, the idea of extending concepts of microservices to the frontend world, the importance of fully end-to-end verticalized systems, and the difference of an orchestration- or choreography-based implementation become reasonable.


Upon a closer look at the advantages and challenges I've experienced in customer projects, it turns out that micro frontends are not a silver bullet either. Rather, they are suited for a specific set of problems. In a nutshell, micro frontends can be a powerful tool to avoid frontend monoliths and this talk will give you the needed knowledge to decide if it’s the right one for the job.

  title: "A different flavor of the distributed transaction"
  description: "Transactions are one of the most complex and yet very important areas of computing. They can get particularly hard when the system moves to the distributed environments as almost every component in the distributed system is liable to failures. Traditional locking protocols, used in transaction solutions today, are then very prone to holding locks on resources for unnecessarily long periods. The saga pattern provides an alternative non-blocking solution with the design that allows individual parts of the transaction to commited immediately and independently. This design is specifically suitable for long running transactions and distributed systems. In this session, we will present a newly created MicroProfile specification called Long Running Actions (LRA) which provides a definition of the transactional protocol and a simple API for the distributed transactions in the Java microservices environment based on the saga pattern. We will show you why the saga pattern is a very suitable transactional solution for many distributed microservices applications and demonstrate the usage o the LRA specification with the live coded demo."

  title: "Chaos Development: Removing software as the inhibitor of Agile"
  description: "
You’re starting a new project. You’re using real Agile (finally!). Kickoffs, initial stories, tool selection… the atmosphere is electric. That first iteration is complete; yes, a few kinks, but we’re rolling now. A couple of more iterations flow by before the euphemism “technical debt” is heard. The next couple of iterations are a bit of a struggle. Finally, it looks like the goals may not be achievable. Programmers mumble about faulty designs and changing requirements. Business owners roll their eyes, thinking, “Here we go again…”. 

What happened? Practical Agile practices were followed, but were mated with very traditional, inflexible programming styles. 


Agile development centers around accommodating change. Stories can be played in business-friendly order. Unanticipated changes can and should be accepted with aplomb. Therefore the design and implementation of the software must also accommodate the uncertain. 


Chaos engineering is the vogue term used to describe the design of systems that handle the unexpected. Similarly, software development must accommodate unexpected demands. It needs to focus on chaos development. 


In this presentation, we will suggest two distinct approaches to chaos development. The first exploits existing OO languages, but employs a particular style of programming, and can be used for most business problems. The second uses an event bus and highly decoupled services, a technique called asynchronous MicroServices, and is appropriate for addressing fuzzy problems.


For the first style, we will delve into the aspects of the style, particularly its focus on small, tight classes; extensive exploitation of design patterns; and careful monitoring of complexity metrics. For the second style, we will briefly address the principles at work, and show a brief animation of the type of problem nicely handled by asynchronous MicroServices.

Our team of developers  build DevOps tools for mainframe developers who often need to work with Java, High-Level Assembler, Cobol or even TypeScript to support enterprise applications running in mission-critical infrastructure spread from mainframe to distributed systems. Our goal is to provide a choice of tools for developers and let them learn technologies, adapt to business faster and enjoy their work in such environment .  In cooperation with several open-source communities like Eclipse Che ( https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ecd.che ) , Eclipse Theia supported by RedHat, IBM, TypeFox, CA Technologies a Broadcom company and others we extend Eclipse Che and Theia platforms with our own implementation of LSP, DAP  https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-che4z .

  description: "In the last couple of years, the popularity of messaging apps has grown rapidly. Because of that fact, chatbots, computer algorithms with the ability to communicate with people in their natural language, became a big thing as well. Nowadays, one can talk to chatbots in a variety of websites, messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, and others. There are a lot of applications where chatbots can be valuable: customer service, handling minor daily tasks, updates and content delivery, e-commerce bots, event reservations, agenda/scheduling, virtual assistants, project management, data gathering, and analysis. One of the most important questions that can be asked considering this topic is: how does chatbot actually work? There are two general types: those that use pattern matching (simpler to implement, usually use the combination of if-else statements and basic statistics), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Natural Language Understanding (NLU) based algorithms, but only the latter type can be really considered as an artificial intelligence due to its complexity. NLP is mostly used for text analysis purposes such as Information Retrieval, Information Extraction or Text Mining. To actually achieve those goals, some necessary steps need to be followed: tokenization, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, discourse analysis, and pragmatic analysis.

  title: "Reactive Spring"
  description: "Microservices and big-data increasingly confront us with the limitations of traditional input/output. In traditional IO, work that is IO-bound dominates threads. This wouldn't be such a big deal if we could add more threads cheaply, but threads are expensive on the JVM, and most other platforms. Even if threads were cheap and infinitely scalable, we'd still be confronted with the faulty nature of networks. Things break, and they often do so in subtle, but non-exceptional ways. Traditional approaches to integration bury the faulty nature of networks behind overly simplifying abstractions. We need something better.

Spring Framework 5 is here ! It introduces the Spring developer to a growing world of support for reactive programming across the Spring portfolio, starting with a new Netty-based web runtime, component model and module called Spring WebFlux, and then continuing to Spring Data Kay, Spring Security 5.0, Spring Boot 2.0 and Spring Cloud Finchley. Sure, it sounds like a lot, but don't worry! Join me, your guide, Spring developer advocate Josh Long, and we'll explore the wacky, wonderful world of Reactive Spring together."

  title: "Inspired to Code"
  description: "Programming is not considered a dangerous occupation.  We sit in a comfortable chair all day, typing away at the keyboard.  Besides a bit of wrist tendonitis and back pain, how bad can this be?   '... much study wearies the body'
- King Solomon.  It is physically exhausting when we think all day long.  What's worse, the stress does not get a chance
 to escape from our body.  Then our inactivity affects our sleep.  And to make matters worse, companies tempt us with lo
w quality sugary foods like donuts and packet chips.  In this talk Heinz will share from his life, how his journey is ta
king him towards better health.  Tips like prioritizing sleep.  Gadgets that will help measure our progress.  (Geeks love gadgets.)  Also some interesting Java puzzles to engage the brain."

  title: "Let's Play!"
  description: "ML and AI technologies are a great tool to automate various business processes. In this short presentation I will try to automate something significant, something which usually takes long hours, may ruin health, lead to sleep deprivation, may even break up families... we will try to teach computers play games so we won't have to. How to translate game play problem into language of ML algorithms? I will explore possible solutions from the simplest manually crafted algorithm through classical supervised learning methods to end up with reinforcement learning based approaches. This presentation may contain asteroids, spaceships, laser guns and a significant portion of poor Python code."

  description: "Join other attendees and share ideas, talk about the recent challenges, or find solution for a problem. During this session you can connect with other like-minded people in a space designated for certain languages, technologies, and interests.
<br/>1. Suggest a topic
<br/>Look for large white sheets of paper, and tell everyone what is on your mind! You can also tweet using #topicforgeecon hashtag. Vote for topics (mark it with line/x/heart) and like tweets to show others you’re interested.
<br/>2. Choose a room and have fun
<br/>We will group similar topics and assign a room. Topics will be pinned before room entrance (list of topics and rooms will be also posted using attendees slack channel - slack.geecon.cz), so you will be able to join others also interested in eg. Kotlin, JVM tuning, Machine learning or testability."

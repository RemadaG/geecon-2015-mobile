  title: "Life Beyond the Illusion of Present"
  description: "The idea of the present is an illusion. Everything we see, hear and feel is just an echo from the past. But this illusion has influenced us and the way we view the world in so many ways; from Newton's physics with a linearly progressing timeline accruing absolute knowledge along the way to the von Neumann machine with its total ordering of instructions updating mutable state with full control of the 'present'. But unfortunately this is not how the world works. There is no present, all we have is facts derived from the merging of multiple pasts. The truth is closer to Einstein's physics where everything is relative to one's perspective.
                <br/>As developers we need to wake up and break free from the perceived reality of living in a single globally consistent present. The advent of multicore and cloud computing architectures meant that most applications today are distributed systems-multiple cores separated by the memory bus or multiple nodes separated by the network-which puts a harsh end to this illusion. Facts travel at the speed of light (at best), which makes the distinction between past and perceived present even more apparent in a distributed system where latency is higher and where facts (messages) can get lost.
                <br/>The only way to design truly scalable and performant systems that can construct a sufficiently consistent view of history-and thereby our local 'present'-is by treating time as a first class construct in our programming model and to model the present as facts derived from the merging of multiple concurrent pasts.
                <br/>In this talk we will explore what all this means to the design of our systems, how we need to view and model consistency, consensus, communication, history and behaviour, and look at some practical tools and techniques to bring it all together."

  title: "Case Study: Agile @gov.pl"
  description: "Agile transformation requires understanding of its rules by management. It is hard to leave status quo and change your way of thinking. It is especially hard when the previous model has been in use for many years. A frequent problem with Scrum / Kanban / Lean transformation is to go hard on deep water. Starting tommorow we're doing Scrum. Lack of understanding, communication chaos and rules distortion \"just because daily is not working for us\". What if take a different approach: slow and prudent? Let say iteratively. Gradually introduce another steps of chosen framework. However the question persists. How to effectively change our conservative organization into agile and constantly changing in response to business needs company?"

  description: "Parallel stream operations are supposed to run faster than sequential operations. Is this expection justified? Or\r\nis is naive? In this session we will explore when and under which circumstances parallel execution pays. In\r\norder to understand the performance model of streams we will discuss certain internals of streams, for instance\r\niterators vs. spliterators as well as reduction vs. accumulation algorithms. The goal is to enable stream users to\r\ncome up with an informed guess regarding the performance of parallel vs. sequential stream operations."

  description: "Who never stumbled upon some bad piece of code? Most of the time, it's not bad, it just had different assumptions. The problem is that those assumptions may have been coming from very far. Come challenge your assumptions in this talk, I promise a good laugh (some of it at the speaker's expenses).\r\n<br /><br />\r\nGiven most of our profession comes from a computer scientist background, it is expected that we use a scientific and verifiable approach in decision taking processes. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Our environment is ridden with irrational convictions that come from out of nowhere. Those are of two different kinds: memes are \"ideas, behaviors, or styles that spreads from person to person within our culture\" while cargo culting is the \"ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose\". Both are deeply entrenched in our community. This talk will try to challenge some of those common ideas, by highlighting the most pervasive ones."

  title: "3 things you must know to think reactive"
  description: "Over the past few years, web-applications have started to play an increasingly important role in our lives. We expect them to be always available and the data to be always fresh. This shift into the realm of real-time data processing is now transitioning to physical devices, and Gartner predicts that the Internet of Things will grow to an installed base of 26 billion units by 2020.\r\n\r\nAs reactive architectures gain in popularity, more and more developers find themselves faced with the challenge of \"thinking reactive\". To leave behind the well-known concepts of mutable, object-oriented, imperative and synchronous programming in favour of immutable, functional, declarative and asynchronous programming requires quite a mind shift and it isn't obvious to take the plunge.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will explore three concepts from the world of functional programming that are at the core of building reactive applications: immutability, higher-order functions and manipulating immutable collections. We will first see how the \"traditional\" mutable, object-oriented approach of doing things can be problematic when it comes to multi-core programming, and then how to apply them to asynchronous systems.\r\n"

  description: "Scala, by being both Functional and Object-Oriented is easy to get started with, especially for java developpers. However, to get the most of the language, you have to embrace its functional nature.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I'll show you how to start using scala's functional nature by presenting patterns originated in the functional world:\r\n\r\n - Algebraic Data Types for data modelling \r\n - Typeclasses for extensible abstractions\r\n - Error handling in a composable fashion with Either and Validation\r\n - Segregation between logic and effects for easier testing\r\n - Property based testing\r\n\r\nEvery pattern will be illustrated with code examples and where it ususally comes in handy."

Unfortunately, there are more than 200 JVM configuration parameters which influence GC in one way or another. Their very obscure names make your command line looks like a magic incantation.\r\n<br />\r\nThe goal of this talk is to demystify Garbage Collector optimisations.

  description: "Netty is a popular open source library that greatly simplifies the development of networking applications on top of the JVM. It abstracts the burden to deal with tedious and error-prone low level details and allows you to concentrate on your business logic instead. It is used by high profile companies like Apple, Netflix, Twitter or Facebook and designed from the ground up to handle high throughput at low latency, even with thousands of connections at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the talk introduces you to networking on the JVM and why a library like Netty is needed in the first place. You'll then learn how to adapt it to your requirements. Finally, you'll see how Netty is used inside the Couchbase Java SDK to help it scale into the hundreds of thousands operations per second.\r\n\r\nIf you have low latency, high throughput requirements or just want to get the last drop of performance out of your networking stack, this talk is for you."

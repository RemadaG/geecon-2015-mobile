  description: "Software, like board games, needs instructions. Should I draw a card or play my card first? Will the connection be reused, or should I use a connection pool? In heroic tales, a protagonist needs directions from elder scrolls to user magical artifacts and complete their mission.

In this talk, Ignasi will explain his journey from neglecting docs to considering them an important step on the software delivery cycle. Ignasi will share tips ant tricks he’s been collecting over the years and focus on which habits he adopted to make sure he doesn’t forget docs. Ignasi will also share the types of audience and cases where documentation can save time and money to your organization.

After discussing the importance of documentation within several teams, Ignasi will try to counter the usual arguments and excuses those who don’t document often use. No, the code is not the documentation, the code doesn’t tell the whole story. You can have a strong type system restricting how to call an API and still be an unusable API: “Hmm, I need a Token here, where do I get it?”.

Join Ignasi for a talk about board games, child tales, and embarrassing PRs.

This talk targets beginner/daily user/experts alike."

  description: "
Just as development should be iterative, software design should change when the context and our understanding of the problem evolve. As a software grows to solve more problems, it becomes less supple in its ability to evolve. Tensions arise within the business model of the software that struggles to stay coherent.


Eventually it reaches a critical mass and becomes a monolith of spaghetti code. How do we know when it’s time to modularize our software? How do we carry on the decision to split it into several modules or services? How can we handle the progressive differenciation of our business models while avoiding unnecessary coupling? It’s not as easy as a clean axe cut in the middle, finding the right boundaries can be tricky.

We would like to introduce the Mitosis Pattern, a dynamic approach used to split a business model into multiple ones that will get shaped and decoupled iteratively. Gain flexibility to choose better when to split into multiple services, and avoid paying the scale cost of microservices or becoming a distributed monolith.

  description: "Computation is increasingly constrained by power. With each advancement in the manufacturing process, a decreasing percentage of the CPU can operate at full capacity, leading to the emergence of the term 'dark silicon'. This trend necessitates techniques that utilize chip area to optimize power efficiency through specialized accelerators.

The presentation will outline key concepts that led to the dark silicon such as Moore’s law and breakdown of Dennard scaling, followed by an overview of current and upcoming CPU accelerators. The focus will then shift to vector units and the specifics of vector programming. Attendees will be introduced to registers, a range of vector operations, and methods to develop branchless algorithms such as sorting networks. The session will conclude with an overview of the new Java Vector API and how it was already picked up by projects to do AI inference (Llama 2) and vector search (AstraDB and Cassandra)."

This session explains how computer chips are physically created by some of the most advanced machines on the planet. Did you know that these chips, nowadays, can contain more than one hundred million transistors per square millimeter?

Java software is used everywhere, also in the process of chip manufacturing. In my project at ASML we’re working on a relatively new analytics platform which is used to process the data from the machines. The application then visualizes the results in order to find issues or improvement areas. This information is used to change the configuration parameters of the physical machine in order to create more and better chips.

  description: "Suppose you have embraced Apache Kafka as the core of your data infrastructure. In that case, you have probably integrated event-driven services to communicate with each other through topics, combined with legacy systems through an ecosystem of connectors, and responded more or less in real-time to things happening in the world outside your software. Immutable logs of events form a more robust backbone than the one-database-to-rule-them-all of your profound monolith past. Your stack is more evolvable, responsive, and easier to work with. However, you might face a challenge now that everything is a stream - how do you query things? 

Although you may name at least one or two ways off the top of your head, it's time you think through how to make the choice. In this talk, we'll explore the solutions currently in use for asking questions about the contents of a topic, including Kafka Streams, the various streaming SQL implementations, your favorite relational database, your favorite data lake, and real-time analytics databases like Apache Pinot. There is no single correct answer to the question, so as responsible builders of systems, we must understand our options and the trade-offs they present to us. 

You'll leave this talk even more satisfied that you've embraced Kafka as the heart of your system and are ready to deploy the right choice for querying the logs that hold your data."

Among those of us who have an unequal struggle with efficiency, a small handful of us are aware of how many lies, understatements, and false promises lie hidden in them.
During the presentation, we will learn anti-patterns in performance testing and some battle-tested practical advice on how not to be fooled by test results.
Should we be afraid of 'coordinated omission'? Why statistics is the highest form of lying, aka a quick course in reading test results. Why are 'latency' and 'throughput' not the same? Why are test datasets as important as test scenarios? What questions do microbenchmarks answer?
Do performance tests have layers? Why isn't performance testing about numbers?


These are just some of the topics I will talk about.
If you are not interested in performance testing and avoid this topic like the plague, you will find out why in this presentation.
However, if you feel like a 'higher priest of the machine' and you are familiar with performance topics, I will help you design tests with greater awareness and interpret their results.

  description: "I’ve worked with microservices for 9 years now, and I’ve migrated systems from monoliths / distributed monoliths to microservices. Companies call me to help them in this process, and I kind of worked my “standard” way of how to do this. In this talk, I’d like to show you step by step what I do when I help companies moving into microservices. This talk is not about how to design microservices per se (I’ve already talked about it a lot, and I give workshops on that) but what exactly I do in the process, and what you should not forget about. So it’s everything apart from architecture itself.

I’ll talk about: How (much) to design the initial architecture, how to build an easy to use tailored service template, what you need in pipelines, how to test the system, what security changes are required, how to teach observability, how to introduce product teams and a culture to get the most of microservices (and what happens if you don’t).

Of course every company is a bit different and this is not the only way to do it, but if I show you what it usually means for me perhaps you will find something you didn’t take into account in your process, if you are ever in such a situation.

And if you are currently working with monolith (distributed or not), this may be really useful.

  description: "AI is automating rote coding and testing tasks faster than we can reskill. As generators, optimizers, and autonomous agents subsume much of what we consider 'development,' where does this leave us architects and developers? Rather than undermine our skills and value, what if we could use principles from emergent systems to elevate software to new levels - augmenting human and machine abilities beyond what either can achieve independently?

This talk will explore an architecture paradigm for crafting resilient, self-optimizing software that learns and adapts perpetually. We'll ground this with reviews of example implementations and working designs that realize many of these goals today.

We'll dive into:
<ul><li> Transitioning from orchestration to emergent choreography
</li><li> Creating decentralized neural-like networks of components
</li><li> Leveraging event-driven state changes and signal flows
</li><li> Encouraging self-organization through selection pressures
</li><li> Discovering reusable motifs akin to simple biological patterns
</li></ul>

Inspired by systems like ant colonies, biological neural networks, and sware intelligence, we can build software exhibiting autonomous, adaptable, and surprisingly powerful behaviors. Using simple interaction protocols rather than monolithic control flows allows simple yet powerful instinctive behaviors and self-learning to dynamically emerge from the composition.

This talk equips architects and developers to view software as adaptive, living systems vs static constructs. Learn about strategic design patterns to imbue our systems' with capabilities to self-optimize, heal breaks, and respond organically to variable demands. Making software transcend its mechanical origins towards co-evolutionary partnerships between human creativity and machineability."

  title: "Dissecting serverless runtimes - from functions to databases"
  description: "As software engineers, we are often confused or biased, or concerned. On one hand, we know there is no cloud; there are just computers somewhere else. On the other, we keep getting hyped about the serverless, whether it be a function, a computing platform, or a database. Then we add cloud-native to the mix, and we get completely mystified. So, let's learn. 

So, let's learn. In this enlightening journey, we will peel back the layers of serverless computing, unravelling the mysteries that often perplex us. We will unveil the inner workings of serverless platforms, shedding light on the orchestration mechanisms, auto-scaling features, and the nuances of the lifecycle. We won't deal solely with functions but look further into other runtimes and applications, each runtime at a time. Cause it's not only functions we see serverless. 

We will try to understand what it means for an in-memory cache to be serverless, a file storage, a message streaming platform, a no-sql database, or a data warehouse. This talk aims to bridge the gap between the conceptual allure of serverless computing and the practical realities that software engineers face. Bridge the gap between 'Hey! I don't need to set up any infrastructure' and 'Where did my data go?!'. During the session, we will stop at each platform example and pinpoint what it means to be serverless."

  description: "Nowadays, it's normal to see cloud-native solutions dealing with a huge amount of information. In this scenario, the NoSQL databases are getting a huge relevant position, but dealing with many NoSQL solutions from many different vendors is very difficult.

In terms of dealing with relational databases, there’s no doubt that JPA specification is a well-established API in the Java world, but what if there's a well-defined way, pretty similar to JPA, to work with NoSQL with Java?

Jakarta NoSQL specification was created to increase the developer experience between Java and NoSQL databases. This spec allows developers to handle easily with many NoSQL databases.

In this talk, we will make a live coding session presenting a solution with Jakarta NoSQL and Jakarta Data. Even more, we're going to mix other Jakarta EE specifications like Jakarta WebSocket."

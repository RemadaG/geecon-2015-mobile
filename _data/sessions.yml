  title: "Life Beyond the Illusion of Present"
  description: "The idea of the present is an illusion. Everything we see, hear and feel is just an echo from the past. But this illusion has influenced us and the way we view the world in so many ways; from Newton's physics with a linearly progressing timeline accruing absolute knowledge along the way to the von Neumann machine with its total ordering of instructions updating mutable state with full control of the 'present'. But unfortunately this is not how the world works. There is no present, all we have is facts derived from the merging of multiple pasts. The truth is closer to Einstein's physics where everything is relative to one's perspective.
                <br/>As developers we need to wake up and break free from the perceived reality of living in a single globally consistent present. The advent of multicore and cloud computing architectures meant that most applications today are distributed systems-multiple cores separated by the memory bus or multiple nodes separated by the network-which puts a harsh end to this illusion. Facts travel at the speed of light (at best), which makes the distinction between past and perceived present even more apparent in a distributed system where latency is higher and where facts (messages) can get lost.
                <br/>The only way to design truly scalable and performant systems that can construct a sufficiently consistent view of history-and thereby our local 'present'-is by treating time as a first class construct in our programming model and to model the present as facts derived from the merging of multiple concurrent pasts.
                <br/>In this talk we will explore what all this means to the design of our systems, how we need to view and model consistency, consensus, communication, history and behaviour, and look at some practical tools and techniques to bring it all together."

  description: "Agile transformation requires understanding of its rules by management. It is hard to leave status quo and change your way of thinking. It is especially hard when the previous model has been in use for many years. A frequent problem with Scrum / Kanban / Lean transformation is to go hard on deep water. Starting tommorow we're doing Scrum. Lack of understanding, communication chaos and rules distortion \"just because daily is not working for us\". What if take a different approach: slow and prudent? Let say iteratively. Gradually introduce another steps of chosen framework. However the question persists. How to effectively change our conservative organization into agile and constantly changing in response to business needs company?"

  description: "Who never stumbled upon some bad piece of code? Most of the time, it's not bad, it just had different assumptions. The problem is that those assumptions may have been coming from very far. Come challenge your assumptions in this talk, I promise a good laugh (some of it at the speaker's expenses).\r\n<br /><br />\r\nGiven most of our profession comes from a computer scientist background, it is expected that we use a scientific and verifiable approach in decision taking processes. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Our environment is ridden with irrational convictions that come from out of nowhere. Those are of two different kinds: memes are \"ideas, behaviors, or styles that spreads from person to person within our culture\" while cargo culting is the \"ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose\". Both are deeply entrenched in our community. This talk will try to challenge some of those common ideas, by highlighting the most pervasive ones."

  title: "3 things you must know to think reactive"
  description: "Over the past few years, web-applications have started to play an increasingly important role in our lives. We expect them to be always available and the data to be always fresh. This shift into the realm of real-time data processing is now transitioning to physical devices, and Gartner predicts that the Internet of Things will grow to an installed base of 26 billion units by 2020.\r\n\r\nAs reactive architectures gain in popularity, more and more developers find themselves faced with the challenge of \"thinking reactive\". To leave behind the well-known concepts of mutable, object-oriented, imperative and synchronous programming in favour of immutable, functional, declarative and asynchronous programming requires quite a mind shift and it isn't obvious to take the plunge.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will explore three concepts from the world of functional programming that are at the core of building reactive applications: immutability, higher-order functions and manipulating immutable collections. We will first see how the \"traditional\" mutable, object-oriented approach of doing things can be problematic when it comes to multi-core programming, and then how to apply them to asynchronous systems.\r\n"

  description: "Stick to the rules! Consumer Driven Contracts as a TDD on architectural level\r\nTDD introduced many improvements into development process, but in our opinion the biggest impact relates to code design. Looking at the code from the usage perspective (by first writing an acceptance test) allows us to focus on usability rather than concrete implementation. Unfortunately usually we rest on laurels not trying to uplift this practice into architecture level.<br />\r\nConsumer driven contracts are like TDD applied to API. It's especially important in the world of RESTful endpoints and microservices. Since it's driven by consumers it's much more user friendly.<br />\r\nOf course microservices are really cool, but most people do not take into consideration plenty of potential obstacles that should be tackled. Then instead of frequent, fully automated deploys via delivery pipeline, you might end up in an asylum due to frequent mental breakdowns caused by production disasters.\r\nIn this talk we will try to show you how to write tests of your microservice's contracts so that your chances to go down on production due to sending improper requests get lowered substantially. We'll present how to move TDD to the architecture level and design the API from the consumer's point of view."

I will also demo PIT, a Java production-grade framework that enables Mutation Testing on a simple code base. If time allows, a demo will also show how PIT can be integrated with Sonar."

  title: "Quality Built In @ Spotify"
  description: "There is an opinion that quality in software development is limited to manual testing on the latest stage before releasing a product. That might be true 20 years ago in the industrial era. But current world is much more dynamic than before. Time to market became the most crucial metric nowadays. Releasing code to production need to be done faster and faster. How to maintain quality on a sufficient level in this fast paced environment? How to find a time to work on quality improvements? Those are two main questions I want to answer during this talk. Do not expect a silver bullet or even receipt to success. But definitely expect a lot of information about continuous delivery/deployment/improvements with a case studies and lessons we learned at Spotify."

  title: "Apache Spark - Living the post-mapreduce world"
  description: "\"Apache Spark™ is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing.\" Above statement is taken from Apache Spark welcome page. It's one of those definitions that, while describing the product in one sentence and being 100 % true, tell still little to the wondering noob.\r\n\r\nWhy take interest in Apache Spark? Apache Spark promise being up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in certain scenarios. Being a super-set of map reduce it provide comprehensible programming model (familiar to everyone who is used to functional programming) and vast ecosystem of tools. In my talk I will both try to reveal secrets of Apache Spark for the very beginners and at the same time introduce more advanced concepts. \r\n\r\nWe will first quickly look at set of problems commonly known as BigData and how they were being addressed through the last ten years by Hadoop MapReduce. I will show you what were the challenges of those approaches and why the industry is now (after a decade) looking for a new solutions.\r\n\r\nWe will then move to Apache Spark. I will try to show you what was the main factor that drove its creators to introduce yet another large-scala processing engine. We will see how it works, what are its main advantages. We will also look briefly on its internals, focusing on the speed up improvements that led to Apache Spark fame. \r\n\r\nPresentation will be mix of slides and code examples.\r\n"

  title: "Everybody lies: Know your tools, metrics and monitoring"
  description: "Measuring right things at right places in an application is not only about good engineering practices and maintaining some vague SLAs. It is foremost about user experience and should impact strategic decisions at highest levels. In order to allocate time for improving performance metrics such as max latency and consistent response times we need to know their accurate value.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem with such metrics is that when using popular tools we get results that are not only inaccurate but also too optimistic.\r\n\r\nDuring my presentation I will simulate services that require monitoring and show how gathered metrics differ from real numbers. All this while using what currently seems to be  most popular metric pipeline - Graphite together with com.codahale metrics library - and get completely false results. We will learn to tune it and get much better accuracy. We will use JMeter to measure latency and observe how falsely reassuring the results are. We will check how graphite averages data just to helplessly watch important latency spikes disappear. Finally I will show how HdrHistogram helps in gathering reliable metrics. We will also run tests measuring performance of different metric classes"

  description: "This talk is distillation of what makes microservices different from normal services. While this talk can serve as an introduction to microservices the real goal is to help tease out the key areas of what is a very broard topic.\r\n<br />\r\nThere has been lots of buzz around Microservices over the last year, but there has often been a lack of clarity as to what Microservices are, or how to implement them well. I've been working to distill down the principles of Microservices to help ensure that we don't just end up repeating the mistakes we made during the last 20 years of service oriented architecture. I'll talk about what they are, the benefits and downsides, and the core principles to stick to do to them well."

  description: "Building fault tolerant applications requires application developers to change their mindset. There's no point building a resilient application if its database is a single point of failure. This talk will go into Cassandra's fault tolerant architecture and why it was the  Datastore of choice for companies like Netflix.\r\n\r\nWe'll have brief introduction to Apache Cassandra, how to interact with it from Java and how its architecture is built around being tolerant to faults. Then we'll talk about how developers' mindset needs to change when dealing with a distributed datastore, topics include: CAP theorem and cross datacenter latency.\r\n\r\nPeople should leave with a good understanding of Cassandra and how using a distributed database is very different from a traditional relational database."

  description: "TestOps is the reclusive member of the DevOps family. Reports of sightings have been few and far between. Although we've heard stories, most of us don't know anyone who's actually seen it in the wild. I've turned to my personal experience as a tester to search for clues about what TestOps is. We'll talk about what testers have to offer in a DevOps environment and look at the magical things that happen when the worlds of testing and operations collide. \r\n\r\nThere will be real-life stories, including:\r\n simulating an environment migration under production-like traffic (+ screwing it up and learning from it)\r\nchoosing an AWS architecture with actual test data to compare performance for different instance types\r\n busting the myth that you can mitigate a DOS threat by scaling horizontally\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll dare to look into the future at what can happen when intentionally applying a TestOps mentality to our job and what regular teams can do to get there.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways:\r\n How getting testers involved in DevOps brings actual value.\r\n Why applying a TestOps mentality to your work can open the door to a whole new type of testing.\r\n Getting there is not as hard as you think!\r\n\r\n"

  description: "Groovy is one of the most readable languages on JVM but does it come at a price? Does it result in some shortcuts that can bite you? No so many but indeed there are some. Most of them will bite you because you haven't read the docs careful enough, didn't think about differences between static and dynamic languages or forgot that Groovy SDK is build on top of Java SDK.\r\nDuring this talk we will take a look at some of those corner cases and to make it a learning experience it will be a deeper look (with lots of questions for you to answer).\r\nExpect to see some AST and have a tiny peek at the bytecode, hear about flow sensitive typing, static compilation, Groovy performance (compared to Java), multimethods and much more.\r\nPrepare to see lots of stuff but no WOW moments (hope you will also have no WTF moments) nor low-level internals, prepare not to learn bunch of new features (although there will be some) but to understand why Groovy works as it works."

  description: "Did you know that every so often, a minute lasts 61 seconds? Or that a leap year doesn't happen every 4 years? Or that sometimes, October 5th doesn't come after October 4th? If that sounds like something that might break some software, you'd be right!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the common ways that time is implemented in a number of libraries you probably depend on and in the JVM, how these representations can fall short of giving us a complete picture of what time it is, and what we can do about this state of affairs."

  description: "ElasticSearch is a real-time search engine with powerful querying and analytics capabilities. Couchbase Server is a leading NoSQL database, designed for scalability, reliability and speed, with a built-in mechanism for replicating data directly into ElasticSearch.  On its own, each one is awesome; combining the two turns the awesomeness up to eleven!\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll learn how to tie Couchbase and ElasticSearch together into a seamless data storage and analysis platform. We'll examine the benefits that each brings to the table and how we can use the former for efficient storage and retrieval, and the latter for fast indexing, full-text searches, and geo-spatial querying. But mainly, we'll explore the most interesting use case of combining ElasticSearch with Couchbase: using Kibana to create dynamic, real-time data analytics dashboards on top of the data stored in Couchbase Server."

  title: "Spring Rebooted"
  description: "You cannot call yourself a Java Developer if you haven't heard of, or more likely used the Spring Framework. Actually the very application I'm submitting this talk with seems to be written using Spring Web Flow, guessing by how the URL looks like ;) There is so many Spring projects nowadays, that they don't even fit on one page - you'll find subpages for several subgroups. At times it seems it's fate was to become a big, heavy, old style J2EE blob. But a fresh approach that came with introduction and release of Spring Boot last year has made it more agile than ever. Looking forward to Spring Cloud this year I feel like I'll soon be dual wielding the power of an awesome framework that boosts my attack... I mean, development speed with powerful constructs and an extra boost to configuration and customization agility. I'll show how to efficiently use the framework to convert a monolithic application into smaller, cloud enabled, Spring driven services. I'll demonstrate a working code at several keys steps along the way and will discuss how to approach the next transition as we go with live coding at least some of them. The aim is to not only show you the tools, but also the path with all it's curves."

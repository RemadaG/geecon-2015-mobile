  title: "Life Beyond the Illusion of Present"
  description: "The idea of the present is an illusion. Everything we see, hear and feel is just an echo from the past. But this illusion has influenced us and the way we view the world in so many ways; from Newton's physics with a linearly progressing timeline accruing absolute knowledge along the way to the von Neumann machine with its total ordering of instructions updating mutable state with full control of the 'present'. But unfortunately this is not how the world works. There is no present, all we have is facts derived from the merging of multiple pasts. The truth is closer to Einstein's physics where everything is relative to one's perspective.
                <br/>As developers we need to wake up and break free from the perceived reality of living in a single globally consistent present. The advent of multicore and cloud computing architectures meant that most applications today are distributed systems-multiple cores separated by the memory bus or multiple nodes separated by the network-which puts a harsh end to this illusion. Facts travel at the speed of light (at best), which makes the distinction between past and perceived present even more apparent in a distributed system where latency is higher and where facts (messages) can get lost.
                <br/>The only way to design truly scalable and performant systems that can construct a sufficiently consistent view of history-and thereby our local 'present'-is by treating time as a first class construct in our programming model and to model the present as facts derived from the merging of multiple concurrent pasts.
                <br/>In this talk we will explore what all this means to the design of our systems, how we need to view and model consistency, consensus, communication, history and behaviour, and look at some practical tools and techniques to bring it all together."

  description: "Agile transformation requires understanding of its rules by management. It is hard to leave status quo and change your way of thinking. It is especially hard when the previous model has been in use for many years. A frequent problem with Scrum / Kanban / Lean transformation is to go hard on deep water. Starting tommorow we're doing Scrum. Lack of understanding, communication chaos and rules distortion \"just because daily is not working for us\". What if take a different approach: slow and prudent? Let say iteratively. Gradually introduce another steps of chosen framework. However the question persists. How to effectively change our conservative organization into agile and constantly changing in response to business needs company?"

  description: "Who never stumbled upon some bad piece of code? Most of the time, it's not bad, it just had different assumptions. The problem is that those assumptions may have been coming from very far. Come challenge your assumptions in this talk, I promise a good laugh (some of it at the speaker's expenses).\r\n<br /><br />\r\nGiven most of our profession comes from a computer scientist background, it is expected that we use a scientific and verifiable approach in decision taking processes. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Our environment is ridden with irrational convictions that come from out of nowhere. Those are of two different kinds: memes are \"ideas, behaviors, or styles that spreads from person to person within our culture\" while cargo culting is the \"ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose\". Both are deeply entrenched in our community. This talk will try to challenge some of those common ideas, by highlighting the most pervasive ones."

  title: "3 things you must know to think reactive"
  description: "Over the past few years, web-applications have started to play an increasingly important role in our lives. We expect them to be always available and the data to be always fresh. This shift into the realm of real-time data processing is now transitioning to physical devices, and Gartner predicts that the Internet of Things will grow to an installed base of 26 billion units by 2020.\r\n\r\nAs reactive architectures gain in popularity, more and more developers find themselves faced with the challenge of \"thinking reactive\". To leave behind the well-known concepts of mutable, object-oriented, imperative and synchronous programming in favour of immutable, functional, declarative and asynchronous programming requires quite a mind shift and it isn't obvious to take the plunge.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will explore three concepts from the world of functional programming that are at the core of building reactive applications: immutability, higher-order functions and manipulating immutable collections. We will first see how the \"traditional\" mutable, object-oriented approach of doing things can be problematic when it comes to multi-core programming, and then how to apply them to asynchronous systems.\r\n"

  description: "Stick to the rules! Consumer Driven Contracts as a TDD on architectural level\r\nTDD introduced many improvements into development process, but in our opinion the biggest impact relates to code design. Looking at the code from the usage perspective (by first writing an acceptance test) allows us to focus on usability rather than concrete implementation. Unfortunately usually we rest on laurels not trying to uplift this practice into architecture level.<br />\r\nConsumer driven contracts are like TDD applied to API. It's especially important in the world of RESTful endpoints and microservices. Since it's driven by consumers it's much more user friendly.<br />\r\nOf course microservices are really cool, but most people do not take into consideration plenty of potential obstacles that should be tackled. Then instead of frequent, fully automated deploys via delivery pipeline, you might end up in an asylum due to frequent mental breakdowns caused by production disasters.\r\nIn this talk we will try to show you how to write tests of your microservice's contracts so that your chances to go down on production due to sending improper requests get lowered substantially. We'll present how to move TDD to the architecture level and design the API from the consumer's point of view."

  description: "There is an opinion that quality in software development is limited to manual testing on the latest stage before releasing a product. That might be true 20 years ago in the industrial era. But current world is much more dynamic than before. Time to market became the most crucial metric nowadays. Releasing code to production need to be done faster and faster. How to maintain quality on a sufficient level in this fast paced environment? How to find a time to work on quality improvements? Those are two main questions I want to answer during this talk. Do not expect a silver bullet or even receipt to success. But definitely expect a lot of information about continuous delivery/deployment/improvements with a case studies and lessons we learned at Spotify."

  description: "\"Apache Spark™ is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing.\" Above statement is taken from Apache Spark welcome page. It's one of those definitions that, while describing the product in one sentence and being 100 % true, tell still little to the wondering noob.\r\n\r\nWhy take interest in Apache Spark? Apache Spark promise being up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in certain scenarios. Being a super-set of map reduce it provide comprehensible programming model (familiar to everyone who is used to functional programming) and vast ecosystem of tools. In my talk I will both try to reveal secrets of Apache Spark for the very beginners and at the same time introduce more advanced concepts. \r\n\r\nWe will first quickly look at set of problems commonly known as BigData and how they were being addressed through the last ten years by Hadoop MapReduce. I will show you what were the challenges of those approaches and why the industry is now (after a decade) looking for a new solutions.\r\n\r\nWe will then move to Apache Spark. I will try to show you what was the main factor that drove its creators to introduce yet another large-scala processing engine. We will see how it works, what are its main advantages. We will also look briefly on its internals, focusing on the speed up improvements that led to Apache Spark fame. \r\n\r\nPresentation will be mix of slides and code examples.\r\n"

  description: "Measuring right things at right places in an application is not only about good engineering practices and maintaining some vague SLAs. It is foremost about user experience and should impact strategic decisions at highest levels. In order to allocate time for improving performance metrics such as max latency and consistent response times we need to know their accurate value.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem with such metrics is that when using popular tools we get results that are not only inaccurate but also too optimistic.\r\n\r\nDuring my presentation I will simulate services that require monitoring and show how gathered metrics differ from real numbers. All this while using what currently seems to be  most popular metric pipeline - Graphite together with com.codahale metrics library - and get completely false results. We will learn to tune it and get much better accuracy. We will use JMeter to measure latency and observe how falsely reassuring the results are. We will check how graphite averages data just to helplessly watch important latency spikes disappear. Finally I will show how HdrHistogram helps in gathering reliable metrics. We will also run tests measuring performance of different metric classes"

Looking forward to Spring Cloud this year I feel like I'll soon be dual wielding the power of an awesome framework that boosts my attack... I mean, development speed with powerful constructs and an extra boost to configuration and customization agility. I'll show how to efficiently use the framework to convert a monolithic application into smaller, cloud enabled, Spring driven services.

  title: "PubSub++ - few tips that make life with kafka easy"
  description: "You've just set up your Kafka cluster and now you are ready to process tens of thousands events per second. \r\nYou decoupled your architecture and now all the communication goes via pubSub bus and you can focus only on providing business value.\r\nIt would be great if that can be true. In real life you need to do a lot of tweaks to have your backbone ready to handle all the traffic you want.\r\nIn the talk we will focus on the project of redesigning the core event bus of the Allegro auction platform.\r\nWe will talk issues on all the levels from network to data serialization. \r\nAfter the presentation you will have answers to the questions:\r\nHow to assure our clients that not even a single event is lost? \r\nHow to respond in less than 65ms even if Kafka is rebuilding its cluster?\r\n...And many other questions you will face as a backbone provider."

  title: "The Emerging Enterprise Mobile Platform"
  description: "The days of the web development platform may not necessarily be going away tomorrow, but there is no question that the next generation of application development is already upon us, and it's all about mobile devices. An Enterprise Mobile Platform supports the development of mobile apps that connect to enterprise resources through a common shared scalable infrastructure platform. It hosts a well-defined set of APIs to access those resources, as well as enabling the use of services like push notifications, device management and geo-location that go hand-in-hand with mobile apps. Furthermore, interactions and operations must be secured using enterprise-grade security, employing proven protocols to satisfy even the most paranoid of corporate IT managers. \r\n\r\nIn this session we will cover some of the basic features and characteristics of an Cloud Enterprise Mobile Platform. We'll show how mobile app developers, server-side orchestration architects, and system resource administrators all play a role in the enterprise apps of today and look at the challenges of meeting the needs of all three in a mobile-focused cloud age.\r\n"

  title: "Go, the one language you have to learn!"
  description: "You live and breathe http. Most of the things you do with a computer involve it. How many tiny little http-related utils have you already created? Is it time to stop? By no means, we all do it. I'd just like to encourage you to write the next one in Go. It's a fun little language, which feels like a cross-breed between C (pointers!) and ruby (concise, powerful syntax). But how much?<br />\r\nWhy, yet another language, but my perl/python/.. does all the things? Well, it does. But go has a few things that make it super sweet, is web-scale and real fun to use!\r\nOr at least come and listen how did we get rid of 87% of our codebase in a day :-)"

  title: "Forgive me, for I have allocated"
  description: "You probably know the mantra that allocation is cheap. It usually is true, but devil is in the details. In your use case object allocation may impact processor caches evicting important data; burn CPU on executing constructor code; impact rates of object promotion to old generation and most importantly increase frequency of stop the word young gen pauses.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis presentation is for you if you are working on a Java based services that need to handle more and more traffic. As number of transactions per second rises you might hit performance wall that are young generation gc stopping whole application for precious milliseconds.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis presentation focuses on optimising object creation rate when dealing with seemingly mundane tasks. I will show few examples of surprising places in JDK and other libraries where garbage is created. We will look into replacements for things such as inefficient and allocating XML, date and number parsers. We will investigate thread locals and object reuse patterns. Finally we will run benchmarks to find out impact of these techniques on performance."

  description: "Presenting the meanders of deploying your applications to Amazon Web Services (AWS).\r\nUsing (hosted) Jenkins for building your artifacts and running them on Amazon is great, but the deployment process is not without hurdles. This talk shows some failed or suboptimal approaches and how to achieve a reliable and repeatable process. Additionally, we take a look at the security aspect while building and deploying, since you are facing different challenges than on your own infrastructure."

Let us discuss how to turn our oh-no-yet-again-a-boring-discussion into something much more exciting, and with better chances of finding good solutions to the problem at hand."

  description: "Meeting-room, rest-room, project-room - standard office spaces that can take very interesting forms, where the most creative proposals come from Google, Microsoft or Facebook. All hanging around projects, based on the elements of effective self-management or aiming in giving employees a moment to lower the stress level or just relax. And how to create room for team improvements? A place where a group of people form a true team and not just the project team? In which everyone, regardless of the attitude or character, struggle to improve? After various experiences of working with many teams - during projects, workshops and presentations - I think I know ... and I already checked that out. Time to share..."

  title: "Working with logs"
  description: "Most developers in their work have probably dealt with logging frameworks as nowadays almost any non-trivial application makes use of them. Although there exists a large number of logging frameworks that manage to get their job done right, it is still difficult to find a program that would help analyze the log files. Most of the time the developer ends up using popular tools like \"\"grep | less\"\".\r\n<br />\r\nIn this session I will briefly discuss:\r\n\r\nhow to organize logs\r\nwhat is useful about logs\r\nhow to browse logs and what are the available tools\r\nhow to cope with legacy code.\r\n"

  description: "We use Docker at eBay. And we love it! With Docker, we have increased the performance of our capacity tests by 5 times! The only issue we had was the plethora of parameters to start each Docker instance. \r\n\r\nWouldn't it be better to have all your containers defined in one place?\r\nIt turns out, that's exactly what we can do. With a neat tool called Fig.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will explore how we manage our mocks, and how this has helped us to drastically reduce our testing time and setup complexity.  By the end of this talk, you will know how to use Fig, and the Docker API, to manage your images."

  description: "As software geeks we live in a culture which displays a certain affinity towards terminology of martial arts. Particularly Japanese Martial Arts seem to offer a certain fascination. We execute Katas, attend Dojos, and perform Randoris.\r\nAre these terms even accurate? Can we maybe learn more from the world of martial arts? \r\nIn this talk I will present the experiences I have made during two decades of learning and teaching different martial arts and explore how they might apply to learning, teaching and the practice of software development.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  title: "Why don't you create your next application without a database?"
  description: "Within every application, data plays a very important role. Currently, we always use a database or a No-SQL solution to store our data externally to the Java process. But this comes with a cost, the impedance mismatch between the object-oriented world of Java and the external data storage. And developers spend a lot of time creating the mapping, writing queries, and optimizing the retrieval from the external system.

With MicroStream the data instances within the JVM memory ARE your database. You can query them using the getter methods and the Stream API with extremely high performance and low latency as no mapping or external retrieval is needed. Your Java objects survive the JVM restart because they are serialized to disk for example with a new, from the ground built up very secure serialization solution.

In this session, you will learn about the revolutionizing way of data storage with MicroStream. The basic principles, how it works, and demos are part of the agenda of this session."

  description: "Ever since my time at university, I’ve always wanted to write the best code possible. Early on, I realized that OOP is the way. I studied SOLID, GRASP and all the relevant patterns and coding practices. After more than ten years of  chasing the perfect OOP code, I realized that my code is finally functional. But how could that be? The answer starts with the basics of object-oriented programming and its goals. I came to the conclusion that OOP solves completely different problems from functional programming. This allows me to think about my code in a radically different way. It leads to modular, maintainable, ready-to-scale code. Forget about polymorphism, inheritance and classes. Open your minds, and let me challenge some basic principles you were convinced are indisputable."

  description: "Mr. Who? Besides one of my childhood heroes, Mr. Miyagi is a fictional karate master from Okinawa, Japan, in the movie serie ‘The Karate Kid’. He was the karate mentor of several people and made them worthy champions. I wanted that too! So began my own karate journey with my own sensei (mentor). Later, I became a lawyer and got a so-called ‘patroon’ (another mentor). Both mentoring relationships have paid off. When I took my first steps in my career switch to the IT world, I discovered that mentorship is not a given. What a pity! Fortunately, I managed to find a mentor again. I experienced it as a difference as night and day.

I would like to talk about the mentorship’s ‘what’, ‘who’, ‘how’ and ‘why’. I would also like to explain the importance of mentorship in our field and what it could offer us as a community. In doing so, I would like to share my own experiences and ideas. To add weight to it, I make a link with research. I have looked at whether I can find my own experiences and ideas back in society, science or both.

  description: "How transaction isolation is achieved in the databases? What trade-offs should we consider?

Can we allow clients to read data, while someone is modifying the same data at the same time?

Transaction isolation levels were defined based on phenomena which are prohibited for different levels. Locking and versioning are used to isolate concurrent access to the same data by multiple clients. Each of these approaches will trade off with throughput and consistency. Understanding of both approaches will help you to make decisions when it comes to scaling your database.

We will play with PostgreSQL to see different phenomena for different transaction isolation level.

We will try to understand how PostgreSQL implemented transaction isolation. We will look under the hood how the row version is checked. We will see the implications of versioning and how to deal with them (VACUUM)."

  title: "How to avoid common mistakes and misconceptions when working with Java on AWS Lambda"
  description: "AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda is chosen for its flexibility, the ease of integration with other AWS Services, and reducing the amount of infrastructure you and your team own. But over time, when the number of clients and requests start to increase, and you start caring about latency, you may discover that there is no free lunch. Clients complain about latency, things you've taken for granted when running your software on EC2 or Fargate no longer apply, and costs start to ramp up. 

In this talk, I'm going to describe some of the lessons learned from working on multiple services backed by AWS Lambda: what are and how to reduce the cold starts, how the JVM makes them even more problematic, when AWS Lambda is more expensive than the less abstract platform, how to use provisioned concurrency and why one of the biggest problems in Computer Science (caching) is even bigger on Lambdas."

Java is extremely fast to start, the simplest Java program starts in milliseconds. It’s the Java frameworks and libraries that slow things down in general. But not all of them…

In this session, I want to show you the truth about Serverless Java and cold starts, what’s slow, what’s fast and why it matters. We’ll go through what a cold start is, how cold starts in AWS Lambda impact your application responsiveness and cloud costs, and what are the options to optimize both. We’ll explore and compare Quarkus and Piranha Cloud, the most modern and fastest Jakarta EE frameworks. We’ll test the limits of what they are capable of, how fast they start and whether we even need to think about any optimizations. Then I’ll explain what optimizations may help if you need to go further, like tuning the JVM, using a custom JVM runtime or building a OS-native binary with GraalVM. However, there are also a few limitations and cost implications of these optimizations, which we'll also explain.

I’ll show and tell, with very few slides. You’ll see live for yourselves how Java AWS Lambda functions built with Jakarta EE can start fast and decrease the cold starts to the absolute minimum which you can barely notice."

  description: "First things first: when there is caching in the talk title, the famous quote from Phil Karlton must follow. So let's get this one out of the way: there are only two hard things in Computer Science -  cache invalidation and naming things. 

Yes, caching is hard. It looks simple at first glance, which leads to a simplistic design and implementation. The application starts slowing down: introduce some caches. Simple library, simply put, a few gets, simple invalidation logic (or maybe not). Fast forward, and we end up with even worse bottlenecks. Instead of fixing an issue, we've just covered it with yet another layer of mud:  stalled data (already invalid) in services which cannot be scaled out (different data lands on different nodes) and traded latency and read-access time for risk of actually losing the data (eventual writes). 

We obviously can do better! In this talk, we will walk through different use-cases (as cache design depends on the use-case) which might require caching. We will look at how caching can be designed effectively. We will start from the business scenario (it's easier to identify with), though an abstraction, to implementation examples on the top of Hazelcast.

  title: "Black Box Optimization for slow, expensive processes"
  description: "When you have a slow, expensive, optimization process, and the results are not as good as you’d like, how do you choose the parameters for the next run? For example, you run a machine learning training session, and the metric you want to maximize, say balanced accuracy, is not as high as you’d like; or you run an A/B test, and the time-on-site and revenue are not too good on either test A or test B.

A new interaction pattern, “Black Box”, as implemented by the new Google Vizier project, addresses these difficult optimizations. You are responsible for the ML training session, the A/B testing, or other optimization process, and you only tell the optimizer the parameters you used, and the metric that resulted. It suggests the parameters to use for the next run, but it only suggests, and it’s up to you whether to use these parameters. The optimizer knows nothing about each trial – not even if it is ML – only the parameters and metrics.

As a result, this approach is highly scalable, robust, and applicable to a wide range of applications.

The focus of the talk is the Black Box architecture, and I will illustrate this with Google Vizier. Its REST API for Black Box optimization is simple, yet also provides richer optional functionality like choice of hyperoptimization algorithm, sensitivity to noise, and advice on early stopping."

  description: "In an ideal world, any code we write would be tested in real time, letting us catch bugs on the fly to write 100% correct code. Automated test cases can help us move closer to this ideal, keeping code behavior stable and implementations regression-free. Test-driven development is a step ahead, allowing us to write better code and extend test suites one behavior at a time. However, all those test cases still need to be written manually, a painful time-consuming process that leaves plenty of room for error. Manually written tests often tend to be flawed, focusing on the happy path and overlooking corner cases and bugs.

In this talk, Markus Zimmermann argues for a new way to dramatically improve unit testing. By generating unit tests based on the current implementation automatically rather than manually, we can improve productivity and catch bugs on the fly, while code is being written."

We have a look at the libraries with an example and the problems each of them has.  In addition, we will examine the Testcontainers framework, which allows developers to test real-world applications by deploying them in containers using the production runtime and its dependent systems.

An application can be tested and remotely debugged using one of the libraries we explore further."

<br/>1. Suggest a topic
<br/>Look for large white sheets of paper, and tell everyone what is on your mind! You can also tweet using #topicforgeecon hashtag. Vote for topics (mark it with line/x/heart) and like tweets to show others you’re interested.
<br/>2. Choose a room and have fun
<br/>We will group similar topics and assign a room. Topics will be pinned before room entrance (list of topics and rooms will be also posted using attendees slack channel - slack.geecon.cz), so you will be able to join others also interested in eg. Kotlin, JVM tuning, Machine learning or testability."

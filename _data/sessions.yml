  title: "Understanding Agile Leadership"
  description: "The Agile world seems to have recently discovered the importance of 'leadership'. This can be very good news and it can also very bad news. It's bad news if the so-called 'Agile Leadership' is a way to rebrand traditional management models, along with their underlying mindset, so that they could survive in a rather different cultural ecosystem — namely, Agile. On the other hand, this interest can be very good news if Agile Leadership is seen as something almost entirely new. Something tightly connected to Agile and, therefore, deeply rooted in complexity and empiricism. Something that carries a deep understanding of human dynamics in highly cooperative, intellectually intense social environments. Something that — last but not least — is equipped with a good deal of self-awareness, system-awareness and self-transcendence. Modern and truly Agile organizations want and need to, among other things: explore and validate multiple options, not sticking to predefined plans; learn constantly, re-plan as needed; leverage the collective intelligence of their teams, for better exploration of options and smarter learning; have built-in resiliency when facing sudden change; getting results out of people's participation, not out of people's compliance. In this sense the whole concept of true Agile Leadership is quite important indeed, because it's fundamental to nurture and support those organizations that really embody an Agile culture, and that are so far away from the 'organization as a machine' approach that's so typical of traditional leadership and management disciplines. Agile Leadership or, rather, the act of 'leading' in Agile is so much different from those disciplines because it's inherently organic, meaning that it has influence and is influenced on a number of different levels in the individual and in the organization: on the personal level; on the collective level; on current behaviors; on future behaviors; on the social relationship level (trust); on the personal responsibility level (participation); on the formal responsibility level (accountability); on the motivational level and many more. This richness and multidimensionality of the act of leading in Agile is such that simplistic mental models (such as the leader being the 'guy at the top') simply won't suffice and therefore a more mature understanding and practice of leading is called for, in the entire organization. In this talk we will discuss the case for Agile leadership, why we need it, what are the benefits to the organization and why it's different from other leadership approaches. We'll talk about the individual skills and 'mental stances' that allow leaders to support an organizational Agile mindset. We'll talk about accountability, personal responsibility and the what it means to influence. Finally, we will challenge a few common assumptions on leadership and suggest alternatives. The intent is to have the attendees leave the room with a fresh perspective on Agile leadership and with practical advice on how to enable this kind on leadership in their organizations. The speaker has been working on Agile cultural shift for organizations for years, helping them to redesign their structures to be consistent with the Agile values, and has been working on Agile leadership well before it became a popular topic."

  description: "You probably know this situation: Your customer asks you to implement “just a tiny, little change”. After a few hours … or days … you recognize that you can’t implement it that easily. At some point, you might even think: “I can’t be the first who tries to implements this!” And you’re probably right … Hibernate provides a bunch of lesser known features that help you to implement common requirements quickly. The problem is that most developers don’t know about them. They spend days to create their own solution when it just takes an annotation or a few lines of code to: - implement multi-tenancy - support a database-specific data type - map an SQL-snippet instead of a database column to an entity attribute - retrieve the elements of a mapped association in a defined order - generate UUIDs as primary keys - write an audit log documenting all changes performed to an entity - and more …"

  description: "In this session, I’ll share how I transformed a lowly Raspberry Pi Zero W webcam into a smart security camera (with motion detection, threat analysis and alert notifications) by combining open source software with cloud based image analysis.

Attendees can expect a short explanation of how to set up their own motion activated webcam and a demonstration of how they can use Java and a range of AWS Services (including Rekognition, Lambda Functions and Step Functions) to help their camera distinguish between an unwanted guest and the neighbour’s cat.

Finally we’ll compare Node.js and Java versions of this solution and compare them in terms of execution speed, operating cost and ease of development."

Electricity costs, cooling costs, and possibly reduction of server farm size. One way to improve Java performance and reduce CPU utilization is to simply generate better machine code. Simply is obviously not trivial but doable. Twitter is going down that road and experimenting with Graal to generate better code and reduce cost."

  description: "Unit testing is nice, but without a proper integration testing you might not know how your application will behave once it's deployed to the real environment. Before the Docker, configuring the environment for integration testing was painful – people were using fake database implementations, mocking servers, usually it wasn't cross-platform as well. But now, we can easily prepare the environment with Docker for our tests. In this talk I would like to spread the word about TestContainers ( https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java ) – a Java library that supports JUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container. A year ago we (ZeroTurnaround) decided to join our Docker-based test engine and TestContainers, and now it's open-sourced, available to everyone, so you can test your apps like we do :)"

  description: "Without any doubt Eric Evans' book 'Domain Driven Design' is being considered as a 'must have read' among many IT specialists from various domains. With the emergence of Microservices Domain Driven Design has become more relevant then ever. This talk explains how the patterns and concepts of Domain Driven Design relate to Microservice architectures. In addition to that I will show off how Domain Driven Design will help you to structure and model your Microservices in terms of granularity, business context and interface design (just to name a few). This talk will also address how you can use Context Maps (from the DDD strategic design) for planning transformations of monolithic legacy application landscapes towards Microservices. Finally we will also take a look at the topic of Domain Events and how they can help us reaching a loose(r) coupling of Microservices that need to interact with each other."

  description: "What is it that makes writing secure software so difficult? Why do we keep making the same mistakes over and over again? One challenge is that developers are busy delivering features and meeting deadlines – giving security requirements less priority. In this talk you’ll learn to use principles and mindsets from Domain Driven Design combined with a pinch of security awareness, to create secure code – while still focusing on your business features. You’ll learn the basic principles of Secure by Design and how to use concepts such as Domain Primitives and Entity Snapshots to harden your code. What a Domain DoS attack is, and how to incorporate security testing in your delivery pipeline. The ideas and tools presented are directly applicable in your daily work."

  title: "Analyzing HotSpot Crashes"
  description: "Abstract: Did you ever found hs_err_pid or replay_pid files in your Java application directory? Did your Java application ever crash and you didn't know why? This talk will unveil the contents stored by the HotSpot crash handler into the corresponding error files and how this information can be used to analyze and reproduce the crash. It will also introduce tools like the HotSpot Serviceability Agent which helps to introspect native core files and extract the relevant Java information from them which is otherwise not easily accessible by native debuggers. Detailed Plan: - run a Java application which crashes the VM - open the generated hs_err_pid file and explain its different sections: - native and Java stack trace - assembler instructions, register info and mapping to HotSpot data - threads, memory, events, exceptions, etc. - shared libraries, system information - different kind of crashes: - crashes in the runtime - crashes in native code - crashes in compiled (JITed) code - crashes in the GC - crashes during JIT compilation - use the Serviceability Agent to inspect Java/VM data structures in a core file: - what is the SA agent and how does it work - features of the SA agent - run a Java application which crashes during JIT compilation - inspect the generated replay_pid and inline_pid files - replay a crashing JIT compilation - problems when using -XX:ReplayCompiles feature - using the SA agent together with the -XX:ReplayCompiles feature Audience takeaway: The session will help you to better understand the root cause of VM crashes. This knowledge simplifies the task of fixing, working around or reporting the problem. Targeted audience: Experienced Java developers who want to analyze and understand the root cause of Java crashes. Everybody who is interested in HotSpot internals :)"

  title: "Live Coding: CQRS + Event Sources system"
  description: "CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Segregation) is not anything new - it’s been a known for quite some time now. In the simplest form, CQRS only states that commands and queries are executed on different objects. Event Sourcing is a way to handle entity state as a sequence of events instead of the current state (and possible snapshots of the history). Often-heard complait about CQRS is that it introduces unnecessary complexity to a system. Surely, CQRS+ES systems do add quite a few classes/objects; messages; commands; queries; projections; events. But, all of those are themselves simple and often does only one thing, following Single Responsibility Principle. In this interactive talk, I hope to demystify most parts of the CQRS+Event Sourcing approach. In this live demo, we start with existing acceptance test describing a full use case (scenario) and already existing controller and repository layers. The coding happens ”one path at a time” showing how * to handle create a command in controller * to handle commands, logic touching multiple domain services / entities * to create an entity that is event sourced. * to create a projection that represents the state of an event at given time. The code exists in Github, with a separate branch for test-driving it oneself after the event. Code is written in Java, making the live programming easy to follow."

  description: "The problem that new technology doesn’t fix is unmaintainable code. The core of maintainable code is clean code with good tests, but that by itself isn’t enough. This talk introduces techniques for optimising code for maintainability, including getting better at naming, explaining code with tests, which code comments you actually need, README-driven development and Minimum Viable Documentation. Traditional, software maintenance involves too much documentation and comments that no-one writes. Meanwhile, naming and abstraction are too hard to always get right, so you need small doses of comments and documentation. More importantly, you need to avoid wasting time on bad comments and documentation without giving up on them entirely. After the excitement of adopting new technology and software craftsmanship comes the horror of your next maintenance project. As Jean-Paul Sartre said*, ‘Hell is other people’s code’. As a lead developer, your future happiness depends on maintainable code."

Description Each of these layers are detailed by offering suggestions and examples (including some performance tests) for the audience regarding what it really matters and what should be avoided when designing for performance. Main topics: - design principles (e.g. cohesion, single responsibility principle, polymorphism / abstractizations, cyclomatic complexity, algorithms complexity, etc) - tactics, patterns, algorithms, strategies (e.g. coarse-grain APIs, batching, lazy loading, asynchronous, non-blocking, stateless, throttling, resource polling, memory access patterns, cache oblivious algorithms, lock free algorithms, data structures, etc) - operating system (e.g. hugepages, NUMA, thread affinity, RamFS, cgroups, IO Scheduler, etc) - hardware (e.g. mechanical sympathy, false sharing, C-states, P-States, Zero bit recording, Raid Levels, CPU stalls, Cache misses, etc)"

  title: "The Emperor Has No Docs"
  description: "Software, like board games, needs instructions. Should I draw a card or play my card first? Will the connection be reused, or should I use a connection pool? In heroic tales, a protagonist needs directions from elder scrolls to user magical artifacts and complete their mission.

In this talk, Ignasi will explain his journey from neglecting docs to considering them an important step on the software delivery cycle. Ignasi will share tips ant tricks he’s been collecting over the years and focus on which habits he adopted to make sure he doesn’t forget docs. Ignasi will also share the types of audience and cases where documentation can save time and money to your organization.

After discussing the importance of documentation within several teams, Ignasi will try to counter the usual arguments and excuses those who don’t document often use. No, the code is not the documentation, the code doesn’t tell the whole story. You can have a strong type system restricting how to call an API and still be an unusable API: “Hmm, I need a Token here, where do I get it?”.

Join Ignasi for a talk about board games, child tales, and embarrassing PRs.

This talk targets beginner/daily user/experts alike."

However, taking a new technology to production requires research and preparation. What is the best way to build and deploy such native executables? Once deployed, how can I monitor them? Can I test them as I do with regular Java applications? What if startup is less important, how do I optimize for peak performance and latency? How do I use frameworks and libraries?
This session will cover all of those steps and illustrate them with examples. We'll also have plenty of time for questions – bring them all!"

  title: "Mitosis Pattern: Scale software while avoiding becoming a legacy monolith without falling into the microservices trap"
  description: "
Just as development should be iterative, software design should change when the context and our understanding of the problem evolve. As a software grows to solve more problems, it becomes less supple in its ability to evolve. Tensions arise within the business model of the software that struggles to stay coherent.


Eventually it reaches a critical mass and becomes a monolith of spaghetti code. How do we know when it’s time to modularize our software? How do we carry on the decision to split it into several modules or services? How can we handle the progressive differenciation of our business models while avoiding unnecessary coupling? It’s not as easy as a clean axe cut in the middle, finding the right boundaries can be tricky.

We would like to introduce the Mitosis Pattern, a dynamic approach used to split a business model into multiple ones that will get shaped and decoupled iteratively. Gain flexibility to choose better when to split into multiple services, and avoid paying the scale cost of microservices or becoming a distributed monolith.

  description: "Computation is increasingly constrained by power. With each advancement in the manufacturing process, a decreasing percentage of the CPU can operate at full capacity, leading to the emergence of the term 'dark silicon'. This trend necessitates techniques that utilize chip area to optimize power efficiency through specialized accelerators.

The presentation will outline key concepts that led to the dark silicon such as Moore’s law and breakdown of Dennard scaling, followed by an overview of current and upcoming CPU accelerators. The focus will then shift to vector units and the specifics of vector programming. Attendees will be introduced to registers, a range of vector operations, and methods to develop branchless algorithms such as sorting networks. The session will conclude with an overview of the new Java Vector API and how it was already picked up by projects to do AI inference (Llama 2) and vector search (AstraDB and Cassandra)."

But, is that easy to go the Quarkus way ? is it hard to migrate an existing app ? For sure in a hello world demo this will look fantastic ( they all look that way don’t they ? ) but, in a real app, is that nice ? is that easy ? is that fun ? In this session I will show my experience from scratch migrating an app to Quarkus, using different technologies as Hibernate, Prometheus, Rest, … and also how you can check your current app and see how easy is to migrate using a foss app to analyse it.

Prepare for a journey of reality, failures, and experiences on the universe of Quarkus , at a ludicrous speed."

This session explains how computer chips are physically created by some of the most advanced machines on the planet. Did you know that these chips, nowadays, can contain more than one hundred million transistors per square millimeter?

Java software is used everywhere, also in the process of chip manufacturing. In my project at ASML we’re working on a relatively new analytics platform which is used to process the data from the machines. The application then visualizes the results in order to find issues or improvement areas. This information is used to change the configuration parameters of the physical machine in order to create more and better chips. I will explain, on a high level, how our applications look like and which Java technologies we use.

  description: "Suppose you have embraced Apache Kafka as the core of your data infrastructure. In that case, you have probably integrated event-driven services to communicate with each other through topics, combined with legacy systems through an ecosystem of connectors, and responded more or less in real-time to things happening in the world outside your software. Immutable logs of events form a more robust backbone than the one-database-to-rule-them-all of your profound monolith past. Your stack is more evolvable, responsive, and easier to work with. However, you might face a challenge now that everything is a stream - how do you query things? 

Although you may name at least one or two ways off the top of your head, it's time you think through how to make the choice. In this talk, we'll explore the solutions currently in use for asking questions about the contents of a topic, including Kafka Streams, the various streaming SQL implementations, your favorite relational database, your favorite data lake, and real-time analytics databases like Apache Pinot. There is no single correct answer to the question, so as responsible builders of systems, we must understand our options and the trade-offs they present to us. 

You'll leave this talk even more satisfied that you've embraced Kafka as the heart of your system and are ready to deploy the right choice for querying the logs that hold your data."

Gemini offers different sizes, from Nano to Ultra, including Pro. Its unique feature is its multimodality: you can give it text, images, or videos! This opens up new use cases for you.

In this presentation, we will explore the Gemini model. With our Java hats on, we will learn how to use its API, especially with the LangChain4j library.


How to get the most out of Gemini? We will see how to extract unstructured data, how to classify text, how to extend the model's knowledge with the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach, and how to use 'function calls' to invoke external services when generating text.


Hold on tight! The Gemini capsule is about to take off

  description: "It is a well-known truth that few of us care about the performance of our code, even fewer of us have dealt with performance tests.

Among those of us who have an unequal struggle with efficiency, a small handful of us are aware of how many lies, understatements, and false promises lie hidden in them.
During the presentation, we will learn anti-patterns in performance testing and some battle-tested practical advice on how not to be fooled by test results.
Should we be afraid of 'coordinated omission'? Why statistics is the highest form of lying, aka a quick course in reading test results. Why are 'latency' and 'throughput' not the same? Why are test datasets as important as test scenarios? What questions do microbenchmarks answer?
Do performance tests have layers? Why isn't performance testing about numbers?


These are just some of the topics I will talk about.
If you are not interested in performance testing and avoid this topic like the plague, you will find out why in this presentation.
However, if you feel like a 'higher priest of the machine' and you are familiar with performance topics, I will help you design tests with greater awareness and interpret their results.

  description: "I’ve worked with microservices for 9 years now, and I’ve migrated systems from monoliths / distributed monoliths to microservices. Companies call me to help them in this process, and I kind of worked my “standard” way of how to do this. In this talk, I’d like to show you step by step what I do when I help companies moving into microservices. This talk is not about how to design microservices per se (I’ve already talked about it a lot, and I give workshops on that) but what exactly I do in the process, and what you should not forget about. So it’s everything apart from architecture itself.

I’ll talk about: How (much) to design the initial architecture, how to build an easy to use tailored service template, what you need in pipelines, how to test the system, what security changes are required, how to teach observability, how to introduce product teams and a culture to get the most of microservices (and what happens if you don’t).

Of course every company is a bit different and this is not the only way to do it, but if I show you what it usually means for me perhaps you will find something you didn’t take into account in your process, if you are ever in such a situation.

And if you are currently working with monolith (distributed or not), this may be really useful.

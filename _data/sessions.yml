  title: "Distributed Systems explained (with NodeJS)"
  description: "Since I've been working on distributed systems I always wanted to go back in time and teach myself what I know now, in order to avoid the silly mistakes I did! Things like vector clocks, the CAP theorem, how replication really works (and why it's needed), what BASE means and in general all about how this stuff really works! 
This is the speech I'd needed when wrote my first distributed system and it's something you need to know if you fancy working in this area. And we will also be coding some very simple examples in NodeJS, with working demos where we will kill processes and freeze networks! It's so easy to understand when you see things in action, we will use powerpoint only for some introductory theory! 
Yep, I am not a big believer of diagrams... show me code!"

  title: "TestContainers – integration testing without the hassle"
  description: "Unit testing is nice, but without a proper integration testing you might not know how your application will behave once it's deployed to the real environment. Before the Docker, configuring the environment for integration testing was painful – people were using fake database implementations, mocking servers, usually it wasn't cross-platform as well. But now, we can easily prepare the environment with Docker for our tests. In this talk I would like to spread the word about TestContainers ( <a href='https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java'>https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java</a> ) – a Java library that supports JUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container. A year ago we (ZeroTurnaround) decided to join our Docker-based test engine and TestContainers, and now it's open-sourced, available to everyone, so you can test your apps like we do :)"

The thing is - modularity is NOT just some new framework! Neither it is a simple set of APIs! It's a complex concept that has been around for almost as long as the industry itself. So in this talk I'd like to take a step back and reason about the fundamental idea of modularity in Java by comparing the concepts of Jigsaw with other Java modularity approaches and implementations that have been around for quite some time."

  description: "Traditionally, Java developers have a strong dislike for JavaScript. Justifiably so, of course. JavaScript lacks a range of features that we all know and love in Java. However, JavaScript has been gradually taking over the frontend landscape. Since JavaScript is the native language of the browser and the browser is available on all devices, the relevance of JavaScript is no longer in question. The only question is how to choose the right tools for the job, since the JavaScript ecosystem is filled with a wide range of technologies, libraries, and tools.

In this session, you will learn how the speaker, a Java developer, has bit by bit, over time, come to like JavaScript. Not so much the language, but the ecosystem and the range of possibilities available. By the end of the session, you will have a thorough perspective on everything the JavaScript ecosystem can do for you, as a Java developer, and how you can make sense of the instability/vibrancy of the JavaScript ecosystem, too.

  description: "The rate of business change is accelerating. Organisations must learn to build the right things better and faster to survive.

Continuous delivery and lean product management help deliver “better and faster”. But we need practices to ensure the “right things” flow into these processes. Practices that help experiment and innovate with new business models, products and services before technical solutions are commissioned.

This need presents technology departments an opportunity to increase their contribution towards organisational agility. Partnering with business to implement such practices and ensure diverse, cross-functional participation is crucial to ensure building the “right things”.

One approach is to introduce GV design sprints into the demand process. Design sprints are a mix of business strategy, innovation, behaviour science and design thinking. They answer critical business questions, focus on greatest impact first, identify new consumer opportunities and lead to smarter allocation of resources.

In this talk we explore the use of design sprints in an enterprise environment to:

<li> Bridge the business-IT divide
</li><li> Build the right thing
</li><li> Increase organisational agility</li>

Thanks to optimizing dynamic native code compilers, Java performance today is very close to the performance of low level languages ​​such as C/C++, and is even better on some classes of applications. Along with dynamic compilers, static compilers for Java have been evolving as well, so there is still no clear winner among these two approaches.

Exception raising/handling is a popular and ingrained mechanism for dealing with faults. Unfortunately, this mechanism is not without issues: confusing control flow, performance problems, ignored faults and bugs that are very hard to understand. But moreover, exception handling is abused; Even in languages with checked exceptions, studies consistently find that the majority of exceptions are ignored, swallowed or handled by a default snippet. It's not uncommon to see elaborate machine learning systems crunching terrabytes of logs to filter out hordes of meaningless exception messages thrown from our code. We can do better.

  description: "Everyone is talking about microservices, and there is more confusion than ever about what the promise of microservices really means and how to deliver on it. To address this we will explore microservices from first principles, distilling their essence and putting them in their true context: distributed systems.

What many people forget is that microservices are distributed and collaborative by nature and only make sense as systems—one collaborator is no collaborator. It is in between the microservices that the most interesting and rewarding, and also challenging, problems arise—enter the world of distributed systems. 

Distributed systems are by definition complex, and we system developers have been spoiled by centralized servers for too long to easily understand what this really means. Slicing an existing system into various REST services and wiring them back together again with synchronous protocols and traditional enterprise tools—designed for monolithic architectures—will set us up for failure. 

As if that wasn’t enough, we can’t just think about systems of microservices. In order to make each microservice resilient and elastic in and of itself, we have to design each individual microservice as a distributed system—a «microsystem»—architected from the ground up using the reactive principles."

The definition of microservice architecture is quite broad and vague: functional decoupling into discrete services. Therefore a number of approaches, with different flavors and implementations is so great - everybody can do microservices differently. In this talk we aim to categorize and make some things clear. Based on experience from multiple companies, projects and f*ck ups, we would like to propose certain maturity criteria which organizations must embrace to start with microservices approach. Without these, things might work but times might become even harder. We will walk through multiple practices essential for successful microservices rollout, validate them and justify. This won’t be a purely technical talk - no successful change in the organisation happened on purely technical bases. We will correlate the maturity criteria with some business drivers, which help team-up business and technical guys on the same side. If your organisation considers microservices, or you - as an engineer - need some argument to better justify the technical choices, this talk might be for you."

  title: "Akka Typed: A fresh look at the Actor model"
  description: "For years there have been voices calling out Akka - the most popular implementation of te Actor Model in the JVM world, for having its interctions loosely typed. This has now changed with the final introduction of the new akka-typed module and with typed persistence module, currently under construction. Akka Typed also comes with a new, behavior-driven philosophy that requires developers and architects to re-think their ideas about actors. How to design & implements actors with that new mindset? How to model & type actor interactions? Answers to this & more in this humble presentation. The talk will take around 60 minutes and is aimed at an advanced audience. Solid understanding of Scala and Akka is required to fully understand it. It will include code samples illustating the Akka Typed API as well as the behavior-driven actor design."

  title: "A Pragmatist’s Guide to Functional Geekery"
  description: "Basic functional concepts like immutable data, second-order functions, lambdas and function composition can already be found in the modern programmer’s toolkit. During this talk you will learn about more advanced functional concepts and how they can solve real problems. I will talk about pattern matching, algebraic data types, type classes, functional abstractions, folding and type-level programming. I will show you a practical example written using today’s Java functional constructs and build up from there. I will use only JVM-based languages to show you how they can improve the code, make it more maintainable and safe."

  title: "Do you really know how to create your objects?"
  description: "When we talk about objects, we think about their behaviors, attributes and interactions. We think about the things they help us achieve. Yet, before any object can participate in any kind of operation or calculation, we first have to create it. Easy? Well, sometimes it is harder than you expect. Unfortunately as developers we tend to tackle even the simplest problem in an over-complicated way. During the talk I will show you the ways of creating objects and I will present you all problems that come with each solution. I will also talk about the problems that become more visible when you create your objects in the right way."

  title: "Distributed Stream Processing Over Thousands Of Datacenters"
  description: "In this talk, we’ll look at what it takes to create a WAN-first distributed stream processing engine for IoT. Assume that you want to battle the traffic of the Mirai botnet of 623Gbps and do real-time analytics of traffic to inform upstream servers of route changes, etc. In this talk, I’ll share the changes and additions made to concord (concord.io) a C++ streaming engine running on top of Apache Mesos to support a multi-tenant workload. We’ll cover the security, debugging, fleet management of tens of thousands of servers while keeping the Akamai platform isolated from accidental or malicious attacks at millisecond latencies."

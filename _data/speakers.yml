  surname: "Sadowski"
  bio: "I am a software engineer with over 5 years of professional experience with a strong background in Java development, React.js and cloud technologies. I believe in three things. The first one: that coding should be fun. Second one: That coding should be considered an art (which means you can't rush it!). And the third one: that sharing knowledge and experience is one of the best ways of providing the value to the entire society! 

I have worked in 3 companies in my my career: Reality Games, Nokia and Sabre. I have an overview on a broad spectrum of modern technologies, having worked in various domains and technology stacks. 

I worked in teams, where I served in the role of a tech lead for a dozens of less-experienced colleagues, which sparked my passions for transferring the knowledge (which I'm carrying on ever since!)."

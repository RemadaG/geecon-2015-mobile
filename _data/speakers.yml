  name: "Jakub"
  surname: "Marchwicki"
  title: "Engineering engineer"
  bio: "Jakub is a software craftsperson with nearly two decades of commercial experience in programming - wearing multiple hats and getting hands dirty in multiple environments. Some languages, some frameworks, blah blah blah - don’t matter. Architect, programmer, manager, technical trainer, tech lead, wannabe entrepreneur, and former JUG leader. There is a fair chance he does non of those right. Jakub divides his time between gaining hands-on project experience and sharing it afterwards with the community at conferences or local Java Users Groups."

  title: "Senior Developer Advocate at MicroStream"
  bio: "After working for 8 years as a Java full-stack developer in various projects, I became a project manager and software consultant.

As a project manager I still work with these technologies, but on top of that we are now dealing with cloud native solutions like Kubernetes, clustering and many more. We are currently working on a SaaS platform to provide a MicroStream cluster as a service."

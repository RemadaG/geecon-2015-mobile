  surname: "Pałka"
  bio: "For more than 20 years in the IT industry, as a database administrator, programmer,
architect, manager and 'onsite disaster engineer'.
I took part in small,medium and nonsensically large projects carried out according to the rules 'Waterfall', Agile and in the absence of any methodologies,
with the same always effect. Which led me to the conclusion that it doesn't matter what you do as long as you do it in the simplest possible way and use the right tools to do the work for you.
Recently I spend too much time exploring JVM's best kept secrets, reading about managed runtime, parsers and interpreters.
From time to time you can hear my low-quality jokes about
architecture at conferences in Poland.
I am also author of a blog on http://geekyprimitives.com/ and full time benchmarking infrastructure engineer at Neo4j."

  bio: "As a senior engineering leader, I bring over a decade of hands-on experience in software development and managing large-scale tech projects. At Schibsted Tech Polska, I focus on building innovative teams, aligning technology with organisational goals, and navigating the complexities of modern engineering management.
My PhD research explores how advancements in AI and shifting generational values are redefining leadership roles, particularly for middle and line managers in tech organisations. I’m passionate about understanding how leaders can adapt to these changes and balance technological innovation with sustainability and human-centred values.
As a conference speaker and mentor, I connect the dots between technology, leadership, and people. My sessions dive into practical strategies for building high-performing teams, adapting to disruptive technologies, and leading in an era of rapid change and ethical challenges.
In my private time, I love being out in nature and taking long walks with my border collies. I also spend quite some time running in the woods and hills. "

  id: "jarpal"
  name: "Jarosław"
  surname: "Pałka"
  bio: "For more than 20 years in the IT industry, as a database administrator, programmer, architect, manager and 'onsite disaster engineer'. I took part in small,medium and nonsensically large projects carried out according to the rules 'Waterfall', Agile and in the absence of any methodologies, with the same always effect. Which led me to the conclusion that it doesn't matter what you do as long as you do it in the simplest possible way and use the right tools to do the work for you. Recently I spend too much time exploring JVM's best kept secrets, reading about managed runtime, parsers and interpreters. From time to time you can hear my low-quality jokes about architecture at conferences in Poland. I am also author of a blog on http://geekyprimitives.com/ and full time benchmarking infrastructure engineer at Neo4j."

  bio: "Fred George is an industry consultant with over 46 years experience in the industry including over two decades of doing object programming and over fifteen years doing Agile/XP. He counts  at least 70 languages with which he has written code. Most recently, he is the leading advocate  of Programmer Anarchy, a post­Agile process that is proving extremely effective and reactive to  client needs, and also advocates MicroService Architectures, the creations of systems with  hundreds of tiny, loosely­coupled services. A veteran of the IBM­Microsoft wars, Fred did early  work in computer networking, LAN\u0027s, GUI\u0027s and objects for IBM. As an independent consultant  from 1991­2003, he counted HP, Morgan­Stanley, American Express, IBM, GM and USAA  among his clients. He gave the first Agile/XP experience report at OOPSLA in 1999 about an  embedded system done in Java, and has mentored many clients in use of objects in Java under  an XP process. He has assisted in XP Immersion sessions with Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, and  Robert Martin. Fred spent a year as a visiting lecturer at N.C. State University teaching Java  programming to over 800 undergraduates, with a generous dose of object design, patterns, and  XP practices thrown in. Fred joined ThoughtWorks in 2003, delivering yet more projects using  Agile processes. He has worked with clients in four countries since then, including a ten­month  assignment in India (where he founded ThoughtWorks University), four months of projects in China, and a post in the London office. In 2007, he joined the London Internet advertising firm, Forward, bringing Agile practices to all aspects of the business, leaving to pursue industry change at the end of 2011. He next was the Chief Architect at MailOnline, the online version of the Daily Mail and the world’s most popular online newspaper. There he completely restructured the IT team along the lines of Anarchy, which has now delivered a completely reengineered rendering of the MailOnline. Most recently, he was a cofounder of Outpace Systems in the US, a firm building solutions for large businesses that exploits microservices and a Cyclone development process derived from the concepts of Programmer Anarchy; he continues with Outpace as a Senior Advisor. He believes in objects, Lean processes, fun in programming, and the client\u0027s successes. He holds a bachelors degree from N. C. State University in Computer Science, and a masters degree from MIT in the Management of Technology. Oh, and he still writes code!"
